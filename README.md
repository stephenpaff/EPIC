# EPIC
This is the code as the sixth part (also called task) of the EPIC research project I did with Indicia Consulting. For it, I developed decision tree and random forest models to classify individuals' cyber status based on behavioral, attitudinal, and personal characteristics. Please see the description in the main file for more detail.
