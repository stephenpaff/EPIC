# EPIC
This is the code as the sixth part (also called task) of the EPIC research project I did with Indicia Consulting. For it, I developed decision tree and random forest models to classify individuals' cyber status based on behavioral, attitudinal, and personal characteristics. Please see the description in the "Decision_Trees.ipynb" file for more detail. 

In this project, I integrated machine learning into an ethnographic project. I have posted my code to help others brainstorm strategies for integrating machine learning and ethnographic data. Humans think best when they can consider each other's thinking, so I have posted it in that collaborative spirit.
